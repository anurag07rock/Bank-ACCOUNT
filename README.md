This is a simple Java console application that simulates basic banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view account details — all through a menu-driven interface.

Features: 

* Create new bank accounts (auto-generated Account ID and Number)
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money
* View account details and balance
* Menu-driven console interface
* Built with clean and readable Java OOP code

OOP Concepts Used:

* Classes and Objects
* Encapsulation (private fields, public getters)
* Constructors
* Static fields for unique ID generation
* ArrayList for storing accounts

How to Compile and Run:

Step 1: Compile
javac BankingSystem.java

Step 2: Run
java BankingSystem

Make sure Java is installed and you are in the correct directory.
